Q1.In a  random sample of 100 patients at a clinic, you would like to test whether the mean RDI is 10 or more using a one sided 5% type 1 error rate.
The sample mean RDI was 12 with a standard deviation of 4. Do you reject the null hypothesis?

Solution: test statistic=(12-10)/(4/10)=5. 
5>qnorm(0.95)=1.64, so we reject the null.


Q2. A pharmaceutical company is interested in testing a potential blood pressure lowering medication. 
Their first examination considers only subjects that received the medication at baseline then two weeks later. The data are as follows (SBP in mmHg).
Test the hypothesis that there was a mean reduction in blood pressure? Perform a two sided 5% level test and give the P-value.

Solution: to construct two-sided t-test in R:
bl<-c(140, 138, 150, 148, 135)
fu<-c(132, 135, 151, 146, 130)
t.test(bl,fu,paired=T)
we have: 
Paired t-test
data:  bl and fu
t = 2.2616, df = 4, p-value = 0.08652
alternative hypothesis: true mean difference is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval: -0.7739122  7.5739122
sample estimates:mean difference 3.4 

extentsion: to construct one-sided t-test in R, we do:
t.test(fu,bl,alternative="less",paired=T) 
we have:
Paired t-test
data:  fu and bl
t = -2.2616, df = 4, p-value = 0.04326
alternative hypothesis: true mean difference is less than 0
95 percent confidence interval: -Inf -0.1951315
sample estimates:
mean difference  -3.4 //noticed the p-value of one-sided is halve that of two-sided, also notice fu is before bl in this case
Given P-value greater than alpha=0.05, we fail to reject the null

Q3. A sample of 9 men yielded a sample average brain volume of 1,100cc and a standard deviation of 30cc. For what values of 
μ0	would a test of H0:μ=μ0 fail to reject the null hypothesis in a two sided 5% Students t-test?

Solution: given alpha=0.05, sigma=30, u=1100
1-0.05=P(-qt(0.975, 8)<= (x-1100)/(30/3) <= qt(0.975, 8))
Lower bound of the interval=1100-(30/sqrt(9))qt(0.975, 8)=1077
Upper bound of the interval=1100+(30/sqrt(9))qt(0.975, 8)=1123
Alternatively, do 1100 + c(-1, 1) * qt(0.975, 8) * 30/sqrt(9)


Q4. To further test a hospital triage system, administrators selected 200 nights and randomly assigned a new triage system to be used on 100 nights 
and a standard system on the remaining 100 nights. They calculated the nightly median waiting time (MWT) to see a physician. 
The average MWT for the new system was 4 hours with a standard deviation of .5 hours while the average MWT for the old system was 6 hours 
with a standard deviation of 2 hours. Test the hypothesis of a decrease in the mean MWT associated with the new treatment using a two sided 5% Z test. 
Does it appear to be effective?

Solution: with Monte Carlo, we do:
nosim<-10000
n1<-n2<-100
xbar<-4
ybar<-6
s1<-0.5
s2<-2
ybar-xbar+qnorm(0.975)*c(-1,1)*sqrt(s1^2/n1+s2^2/n2) //notice instead of qt in t-test, we do qnorm for two-sided z-test
we have:
[1] 1.595943 2.404057
Since the decreases is non-zero(1.596-2.404), thus there is an effect.


Q5. Suppose that 18 obese subjects were randomized, 9 each, to a new diet pill and a placebo. Subjects’ body mass indices (BMIs) were measured at a baseline 
and again after having received the treatment or placebo for four weeks. The average difference from follow-up to the baseline (followup - baseline) 
was −3 kg/m2 for the treated group and 1 kg/m2 for the placebo group. The corresponding standard deviations of the differences was 1.5 kg/m2 for the 
treatment group and 1.8 kg/m2 for the placebo group. Does the change in BMI over the two year period appear to differ between the treated and placebo 
groups?  Assuming of the underlying data normality and a common population variance, test the hypothesis with a two sided t test.

Solution: to construct a two-sided 5% t-test in R, we do:
n_plac <- n_treat <- 9
mudiff_treat <- -3
mudiff_plac <- 1
sddiff_treat <- 1.5
sddiff_plac <- 1.8
 
s <- sqrt(((n_plac-1)*sddiff_plac^2 + (n_treat-1)*sddiff_treat^2)/(n_plac + n_treat -2)) //unequal variances
t <- (mudiff_treat-mudiff_plac)/(s*sqrt(1/n_plac + 1/n_treat))
2*pt(t,n_plac + n_treat-2) //multiplied by 2, since this is two-sided test
we have: [1] 0.0001025174
Since the resulting p value is 0.0001, less than 0.025, hence reject at the 5% level


Q6.Suppose that 18 obese subjects were randomized, 9 each, to a new diet pill and a placebo. Subjects’ body mass indices (BMIs) were measured at a baseline
and again after having received the treatment or placebo for four weeks. The average difference from follow-up to the baseline (followup - baseline) was −3
kg/m2 for the treated group and 1 kg/m2 for the placebo group. The corresponding standard deviations of the differences was 1.5 kg/m2 for the treatment 
group and 1.8 kg/m2 for the placebo group. Does the change in BMI over the two year period appear to differ between the treated and placebo groups?  
Assuming normality of the underlying data and a common population variance, give the relevant 95% t confidence interval.

Solution: notice assume normality for the test, so we do:
n1<-n2<-9
xbar<--3 //treated
ybar<-1  //ctl
s1<-1.5
s2<-1.8
xbar-ybar+qt(0.975,16)*c(-1,1)*sqrt(s1^2/n1+s2^2/n2) //treated-ctrl, not the other way around
which gives:
[1] -5.655699 -2.344301

Q7. Suppose that systolic blood pressures were taken on 16 oral contraceptive users and 16 controls at baseline and again then two years later. The average 
difference from follow-up SBP to the baseline (followup - baseline) was 11 mmHg for oral contraceptive users and 4 mmHg for controls. The corresponding 
standard deviations of the differences was 20 mmHg for OC users and 28 mmHg for controls. Assuming that blood pressure are normally distributed and an 
equal variance, give a P-value for a two sided hypothesis test that the change in BP differs for OC users compared to controls.

Solution:
n_plac <- 16
n_treated<- 16
mudiff_treat <- 11
mudiff_plac <- 4
sddiff_plac <- 20
sddiff_treat <- 28

s <- sqrt(((n_plac-1)*sddiff_plac^2 + (n_treat-1)*sddiff_treat^2)/(n_plac + n_treat -2))
t <- (mudiff_plac-mudiff_treat)/(s*sqrt(1/n_plac + 1/n_treat))
2*pt(t,n_plac + n_treat-2)
which gives:
[1] 0.4222096

Q8.Researchers would like to conduct a study of 100 healthy adults to detect a four year mean brain volume loss of  .01mm3. 
Assume that the standard deviation of four year volume loss in this population is .04mm3. What would be the power of the study for a 5% one sided test 
versus a null hypothesis of no volume loss?

Solution: alpha=0.05, sigma=0.04, x=0.01, n=100
power.t.test(n=100,delta=0.01/0.04,type="one.sample",alt="one.sided")
Alternatively, test statistic=sqrt(n)*(x/sigma)=10*(0.01/0.04)=2.5
Since this is one-sided test, pnorm(0.95(<-1-alpha))=1.645,
1.645-0.01*10/0.04=-0.855
thus, pnorm(-0.855, lower.tail=FALSE)
we get:
One-sample t test power calculation 
n = 100
delta = 0.25
sd = 1
sig.level = 0.05
power = 0.7989855
alternative = one.sided

alternatively, we get
[1] 0.8037244

Q9. The Daily Planet ran a recent story about Kryptonite poisoning in the water supply after a recent event in Metropolis. Their usual field reporter, 
Clark Kent, called in sick and so Lois Lane reported the stories. Researchers sampled 288 individuals and found mean blood Kryptonite levels of 44, 
both measured in Lex Luthors per milliliter (LL/ml). They compared this to 288 sampled individuals from Gotham city who had an average level of 42.04. 
Report the Pvalue for a two sided Z test of the relevant hypothesis. Assume that the standard deviation is 12 for both groups.

Solution:
2*pnorm(44,mean=42.04,sd=sqrt(12^2/288+12^2/288),lower.tail=F)
[1] 0.04999579

Q10. As your variance goes up, what happens to power?
test statistic=sqrt(n)(x-u)/sigma; if sigma goes up, power goes down


Q11. Suppose that you have three independent samples from a N(μ1,σ2), N(μ2,σ2) and N(μ3,σ2) respectively of size n1, n2 and n3. Let 
S1^2, S2^2 and S3^2 be the associated sample variances. Would 1/3*S1^2+1/3*S2^2+1/3*S3^2 be unbiased?

Solution: 
E[1/3*S1^2+1/3*S2^2+1/3*S3^2]=E[1/3*S1^2]+E[1/3*S2^2]+E[1/3*S3^2]=1/3(σ^2)*3=σ^2, thus it is unbiased without assuming normality.


Q12. Consider any of the hypothesis tests we've covered in class. If you know you reject at a specific level of α, then you know what else?

Solution: You would reject for any larger value of α.


Q13. 
Consider a one sided α level single group Z test of H0:μ=μ0 versus the alternative Ha:μ<μ0 with the data X_bar for the sample mean and s for 
the sample standard deviation with n measurements. What are the collection of points for which you would fail to reject the hypothesis?

Solution: pValue > alpha: fail to reject H0.
sqrt(n)*(x-u0)/s>Z(alpha), u0<x-s*Z(apha)/sqrt(n)=x+s*Z(1-alpha)/sqrt(n)
